## About The Project

  This repository Contains some projects I made, in order to learn more about some technologies (more emphasis on JavaScript).

### Calculator
  This is a simple calculator, wich have all the basic operators. When I did it, I already have a acceptable/considerable knowledge on HTML and CSS, so I just did a lot of research about JavaScript. This pproject helped me to understand the conection between the HTML and JS, with some functions that JS aleady provides.
